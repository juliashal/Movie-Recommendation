# Movie-Recommendation
MovieLens dataset analysis and machine learning model creation.  
The aim of the project is to analyse a 10ml lines dataset of users' ratings for movies they watched.  
In the project I assessed different models, chose the best which minimizes RMSE and tested it on the Validation dataset (1ml records).
